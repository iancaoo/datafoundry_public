## ✨ Why DataFoundry

Modern data agents need more than a chat model. They need selected context, datasource boundaries, SQL policy,
auditable events, durable outputs, and a frontend protocol that can replay the whole run.

DataFoundry puts those pieces behind one runtime:

- 🔎 **Schema-first analysis** — the agent inspects datasource structure before it can run read-only SQL.
- 🧠 **Governed context** — conversation history, memory, tool results, files, and knowledge sources are compiled under one budget.
- 🧾 **Auditable execution** — AG-UI events, SQL audit logs, artifacts, and session history are persisted as replayable records.
- 📦 **Unified assets** — uploads, workspace files, generated outputs, and KB imports share the same deduplicated asset layer.
- 🧩 **Protocol-ready runtime** — CopilotKit / AG-UI clients consume the same events, run state, artifacts, and replay data.

## 🗄️ Bring Your Data Stack

DataFoundry is built around a Data Gateway adapter boundary. The current runtime already recognizes local files,
embedded databases, cloud warehouses, lakehouse engines, operational databases, and search / NoSQL systems.

## 🧭 How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/runtime-flow.png" alt="DataFoundry runtime flow" width="100%">
</p>

The frontend talks to a single backend runtime. The backend owns identity, run replay, context assembly, memory,
tool policy, SQL guardrails, file references, and artifact creation. The model sees a governed prompt; it never sees raw
datasource credentials. 🛡️

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
npm run dev
```

Open the workbench:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/data-tasks
```

The local workbench includes a demo DuckDB datasource. Live agent runs require a real LLM key in `.env`.

```text
LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
LLM_MODEL=qwen-plus
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
```

DeepSeek and other OpenAI-compatible providers use the same provider mode:

```text
LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-chat
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
LLM_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
```

## 🧩 What You Can Build With It

| Use case | Runtime support |
| --- | --- |
| Natural-language database analysis | Datasource selection, schema inspection, SQL guard, query limit, timeout, audit log, table artifact. |
| File-backed agent work | Session workspace, cross-session workspace assets, file refs, downloads, generated deliverables. |
| Knowledge-assisted analysis | KB imports, document chunks, local search, optional embedding-backed retrieval, governed context injection. |
| Frontend agent UX | CopilotKit / AG-UI streaming, run replay, task state, token usage, artifacts, interaction suspension. |
| Controlled tool extension | Mastra tools, MCP middleware, workspace tools, skill packages, tool observation adapters. |

## 🛠️ Developer Loop

```bash
npm run build
npm run smoke:config-api
npm run smoke:data-gateway
npm run smoke:copilotkit
npm run smoke:docs
```

Use targeted smoke checks for the package you touch. `package.json` lists the full verification set.

## 🤝 Contributing

DataFoundry is moving quickly, so small, well-scoped contributions are easiest to review.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, verification, and hygiene rules.

1. Open an issue or discussion for behavioral changes, protocol changes, datasource adapters, and agent-policy changes.
2. Keep pull requests focused on one runtime boundary or feature area.
3. Run `npm run build` and the targeted smoke checks for the packages you touched.
4. Update docs when a change affects setup, APIs, datasource configuration, event behavior, or user-visible output.
5. Do not commit credentials, local databases, generated storage, or private benchmark data.

## 🛣️ Progress And Roadmap

- [ ] **Semantic data operating layer** - Build a durable business semantic layer for metrics, entities, joins, lineage, policies, and reusable analytical concepts.
- [ ] **Autonomous analyst loops** - Let agents plan investigations, run controlled experiments, critique findings, and converge on evidence-backed conclusions.
- [ ] **Evaluation and reliability lab** - Create repeatable NL2SQL, retrieval, tool-use, and end-to-end task benchmarks with regression gates and failure forensics.
- [ ] **Multimodal knowledge fabric** - Unify tables, documents, notebooks, charts, images, logs, and generated files into one governed context and retrieval fabric.
- [ ] **Agent app platform** - Expose DataFoundry as a platform for domain-specific analytical agents, reusable workflows, custom tools, and shareable agent apps.
- [ ] **Enterprise control plane** - Add multi-tenant governance for identity, RBAC, approvals, audit export, policy-as-code, cost limits, and deployment operations.

### Recent Progress

- **2026-07-01: DataFoundry first complete release** - DataFoundry now ships as a full-stack governed AI data workbench: a Web workbench and TUI share one TypeScript agent runtime, CopilotKit / AG-UI event stream, replayable run history, task state, SQL audit trail, artifact output, and unified file asset layer. The first release connects natural-language analysis to real datasource registration, connection testing, schema introspection, table preview, read-only SQL execution, row limits, masking, knowledge imports, workspace files, MCP resources, packaged skills, a built-in data-analysis skill, and model configuration. In short, DataFoundry has moved from an agent demo into an extensible data-agent operating foundation for safe, traceable, and reusable analytical work.
